Not to mention my order wasn't placed for 2 days! 2 DAYS after my zoom consultant then the order was placed, I am about 5 days later with NO SHIPPING INFORMATION. Don't get me started on how much OVER PRICED I was charged.  That same medication was over 50% less in an actual veterinarian clinic. RIDICULOUSLY PRICEDI. DO. NOT. RECOMMEND.

I spent probably 20 minutes with him going through a thorough medical history review and then using my video and photos to show him the affected area. He eliminated several of my concerns that I found (erroneously) through Dr. Google (LOL). In all, amazing find. I got an OTC to help and I wish more people knew about this service.",

I asked why they couldnt just tell me that and cancel the appointment instead of wasting my time. They refunded me and cancelled my subscription. I have two seperate emails confirming they cancelled. Well a month later they charged me again. This is an scam to try to get people to forget they have a subscription and charge monthly. They commit fraud when they say that your subscription is cancelled but still charge. you can also only cancel through email and there is no way to remove your payment method on the website. i have had to report the fraud to my credit card. do not use!!I sent 3 emails to dutch (responding to the feb 7 confirmation that my subscription was cancelled) telling them to refund my money and remove my information from their website. Instead of responding, they marked my trustpilot review as illegal. Charging a credit card you are not authorized to charge = fraud. Its clear they try hard to scrub negative reviews online.",

But I lost almost 3 days responding to my cat's veterinary needs because of their misleading advertisement followed by their only telling me their actual capabilities after I'd asked for what I needed - real veterinary care.The moral of this story: Just because you see an ad when you search for \"mobile veterinary service\" in your area, you have no guarantee that you are getting what you searched for.

        "After seeing the good reviews I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. My dog has been dealing with some skin issues and I was really looking forward to her being prescribed a strong topical or oral prescription. I\u2019d made a point to tell the vet I have tried NUMEROUS otc items with no success. The vet said that they would prescribe some stuff after the call and I\u2019d see it in my profile and then I approve or deny the items. Ok, great! Well things turned out not so great. I take a look after the call and see that every item they prescribed is otc. Not only that but the vet threw in items to treat tear stains when I never mentioned my dog having them (she never has) and the prices were ridiculous. Every item listed I could get a better product off Amazon for the same price, half the price, and even a third of the price! I also learned that the shipping process is not quick. But Amazon? I can get those items next day. Even Chewy would be quicker. Honestly, I would like to rate two stars but I\u2019m not sure if I just had bad luck with the one vet I saw so I don\u2019t want to speak for others and say this service is a complete waste. There may be vets that actually listen and are helpful. Sadly, I did not get one of them.",
